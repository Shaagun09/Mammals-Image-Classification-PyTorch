    "### Step 1: Hyperparameter Tuning Without Learning Rate Decay\n",
    "In this step, ClearML was utilized to perform hyperparameter optimization on a basic CNN model. A range of hyperparameters, including the number of layers, filters, learning rate, momentum, and weight decay, were explored using Uniform and LogUniform parameter ranges. The goal was to minimize the training loss. Random Search was the fallback optimizer when advanced optimization strategies (Optuna or hpbandster) were unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations:\n",
    "- The optimization successfully identified hyperparameter combinations that reduced the training loss.\n",
    "- The parallel coordinates plot from ClearML provided insights into which parameters had the most significant impact on the loss metric.\n",
    "- A total of 5 experiments were conducted, with two top-performing configurations saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning With Learning Rate Decay\n",
    "This step introduced an additional hyperparameter for learning rate decay. This modification was aimed at observing the effect of gradually reducing the learning rate during training, which often improves convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations:\n",
    "- Learning rate decay helped refine the model's performance, especially in cases where overfitting might occur.\n",
    "- The ClearML platform visualized the parameter correlations and the resulting performance metrics, helping identify the optimal setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Model Evaluation\n",
    "The best model obtained from the hyperparameter tuning process was evaluated on the test dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to quantify the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results:\n",
    "  - Accuracy: 70%\n",
    "  - Precision: 81%\n",
    "  - Recall: 70%\n",
    "  - F1 Score: 67%\n",
    "  \n",
    "The precision was higher than the recall, indicating that the model was more conservative in making predictions, possibly avoiding false positives at the cost of missing some true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insights\n",
    "The experiment demonstrates the importance of systematic hyperparameter tuning and evaluation. By leveraging tools like ClearML, the process becomes transparent, reproducible, and efficient. Although the model's performance metrics are decent, further improvements could be made by addressing dataset limitations and exploring advanced optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The hyperparameter tuning process with and without learning rate decay provided valuable insights into the effects of different configurations. The model achieved reasonable performance, and the analysis of ClearML's visualizations guided the selection of the optimal setup."
